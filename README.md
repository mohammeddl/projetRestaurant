## Project Description

Welcome to the MinellasDiner restaurant website. This website is designed to provide information about our restaurant, including our menu, location, and contact details. The website is divided into two main sections:
- **Home Page**: Provides an introduction to our restaurant and highlights our featured dishes.
- **Contact Page**: Allows users to view our location on a map and send us messages through a contact form.
- **menu.html** - This page is for displaying your menu. It's divided into different sections for fast food and sandwiches.
-**aboutUs.html** - This page provides information about your restaurant. It includes details about your business and a "Read More" button for more information. The footer is the same as in the homepage.
